# Training Program Reference Document

## 1. RPE Progression Guidelines
- **Week 1:** Baseline RPE targets (technical, not maximal).
- **Week 2:** Increase all Squat, Bench, Deadlift sets by **+0.5 RPE** (same reps/sets, minor load bump or slight rep reduction if needed).
- **Week 3:** Increase all Squat, Bench, Deadlift sets by **+1.0 RPE** from Week 1.
- **Accessories:** Maintain **RPE 8–9** throughout all weeks (no progression unless otherwise specified).
- Never exceed RPE 9.5 on main lifts in planned training.

## 2. Example Weekly Main & Secondary Lift Layouts
(Adjust based on user frequency and preferences; keep the same days each week)

| Day        | Main Lift (S/B/D)  | Secondary / Variation Lift | Accessories         |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Monday** | Squat (Comp)      | Bench (Volume)             | Quads, Triceps      |
| **Tuesday**| Bench (Comp)      | Squat (Pause)               | Chest, Shoulders    |
| **Thursday**| Deadlift (Comp)  | Bench (Tempo)               | Hamstrings, Lats    |

## 3. Variation Guidelines

**When & Why to Use Variations:**
- **Paused Deadlift:** Improve off-the-floor strength & position control. Often programmed lighter than comp pulls, RPE 6.5–8.
- **Tempo Squat (e.g., 3-0-0 or 3-2-0):** Build control and stability; used in lighter volume blocks or for technique emphasis.
- **Close Grip Bench:** Build triceps lockout strength and shoulder stability.
- **Front Squat:** Improve quad strength and upright posture; often paired with lighter deadlift day.

**Placement Rules:**
- Variations should not replace competition lifts entirely unless in a rehab or hypertrophy block.
- Use in the secondary slot of the day; volume is slightly lower than main lift.
- Keep RPE lower on high-technique-demand variations (e.g., tempo, paused) to preserve quality.

## 4. Accessory Movement Programming

**General Principles:**
- 2–4 accessories per session.
- Train in **RPE 8–9** range for hypertrophy/strength support.
- Keep reps in **8–15** range unless otherwise noted.
- Choose accessories that target weak points from main lifts.

**Examples:**
- **Tricep Pushdown:** High-rep, low fatigue, focus on lockout strength.  
  - 3–4 sets × 12–15 reps @ RPE 8–9
- **Pendulum Squat:** Quad hypertrophy without heavy spinal loading.  
  - 3–4 sets × 8–12 reps @ RPE 8–9
- **Barbell Row / Chest Supported Row:** Back thickness, bench stability.  
  - 3 sets × 8–12 reps @ RPE 8
- **Bulgarian Split Squat:** Unilateral quad & glute strength, stability.  
  - 3 sets × 10–12 reps @ RPE 8

## 5. Day-to-Day Consistency Rule
- The **day** a session occurs in Week 1 must be the **same** in Weeks 2 & 3.  
  (e.g., Monday W1 session → Monday W2 & W3 session, with only RPE changes for main lifts.)
- Session order, movement order, and accessory categories should be consistent across weeks unless specified for progression.
