# Lionheart Data Remodel

Reference design for the training-data remodel. Decisions here are settled unless marked
open. Build against this document.

## Motivation

The existing hierarchy (Session → Movement → MovementData → Lift/DT sets) demands full
structure on every log. Real logging is often terse ("sled pull+push worked up to 235,
2 or 3 sets"). **Fidelity is a first-class axis**: looseness is a genuinely smaller typed
shape, never nullable columns on a god-schema. Every entry — however loose — must still
feed analytics and RAG.

## Principles

- Typed domain, JSON storage. Sealed record hierarchies in C#; polymorphic lists persist
  as jsonb. Impossible states are unrepresentable; storage stays schema-flexible.
- Structuring is additive enrichment, never replacement. The raw utterance survives any
  upgrade to a richer type.
- Two annotation channels on everything analyzable: **facets** (closed vocabulary →
  deterministic SQL analytics) and **embedding + valence** (semantic → RAG, emergent
  analytics).
- One interpretation engine (Parse → Resolve → Commit), versioned and re-runnable, serves
  ingest, freeform→structured upgrades, and full-history backfill.

## Domain model

### Period (shared temporal shape)

```csharp
public abstract record Period;
public sealed record Instant(DateTime At) : Period;
public sealed record Interval(DateTime Start, DateTime End) : Period;
```

### Decoration (the annotation payload)

```csharp
public sealed record Decoration(
    IReadOnlyList<Facet> Facets,      // closed-vocab (axis, canonical value)
    IReadOnlyList<string> FreeTags,   // open labels for semantic recall
    Valence Valence,                  // Positive | Negative | Neutral | Mixed
    EmbeddingRef Embedding,           // pgvector handle over summary text
    int DecoratorVersion);            // which extractor produced this

public sealed record Facet(FacetAxis Axis, string Value);
public enum FacetAxis { Modality, MovementPattern, MuscleRegion, Intent, LifeDomain, BodyState }
```

**Axes are fixed; values grow.** Canonical values live in a lookup table; the LLM proposes
values and a semantic resolver snaps near-matches to existing canonicals (accumulating
aliases) or admits new canonicals below a similarity threshold — the same
`UnresolvedReference`/`EntityMatch` flow already used for movements and equipment.

```csharp
public sealed record FacetValue(
    FacetAxis Axis, string Canonical,
    IReadOnlyList<string> Aliases, EmbeddingRef Embedding);
```

Decoration fill-state is explicit, never null:

```csharp
public abstract record DecorationState;
public sealed record NotDecorated : DecorationState;
public sealed record Decorated(Decoration Decoration) : DecorationState;
```

**Timing: sessions are decorated on completion, not intra-session.** Contexts are
decorated at creation.

### Utterance (how an entry was logged)

```csharp
public abstract record Utterance;
public sealed record Texted(string RawText, double StructureConfidence) : Utterance;
public sealed record Formed : Utterance;
```

Freeform logging is a **first-class choice**, not a fallback. When the model can lift
structure from a texted entry it does (Texted source survives on the structured type);
when it can't, the entry stays `FreeformSet`. Upgrading later is the state transition
`FreeformSet → LiftSet` etc., re-running the parse — the words are never lost.
`StructureConfidence` carries ambiguity ("2 or 3 sets") without blocking the log.

### SetEntry (sealed, per-modality shapes)

Flat ordered list on the session. Movement grouping is derivable from consecutive
`MovementDataId`s — the old `Movement` wrapper entity is deleted. `MovementData`
(base + equipment + modifier identity) is kept; PRs hang off it.

```csharp
public abstract record SetEntry
{
    public required Utterance Source { get; init; }
    public required IReadOnlyList<Facet> Facets { get; init; }  // per-set facets (cheap);
}                                                               // embeddings stay session-level

public sealed record LiftSet(
    Guid MovementDataId, int Reps, double Weight, WeightUnit Unit, Rpe Rpe) : SetEntry;
public sealed record DistanceTimeSet(
    Guid MovementDataId, double Distance, DistanceUnit Unit, TimeSpan Duration, Rpe Rpe) : SetEntry;
public sealed record TrailRunSet(
    double Distance, DistanceUnit Unit, TimeSpan Duration, double ElevationGainMeters, Rpe Rpe) : SetEntry;
public sealed record FreeformSet : SetEntry;   // structure lives in Source.RawText + Facets
```

Pace is derived (distance ÷ duration), not stored. Optional-but-common values get
encapsulated fill-state instead of nulls:

```csharp
public readonly record struct Rpe   // Rpe.Unrated or Rpe.Of(8.5)
{
    public bool IsRated { get; }
    public double Value { get; }    // valid only when IsRated
}
```

### TrainingSession (lifecycle as sealed subtypes)

Status enum (incl. the provenance-smuggling `AIModified`) is replaced by subtypes whose
fields match their state — prescriptions live only on planned, actuals only on completed:

```csharp
public abstract record TrainingSession
{
    public required Guid TrainingSessionId { get; init; }
    public required Guid UserId { get; init; }
    public required string Notes { get; init; }
    public required Provenance Provenance { get; init; }   // User | AiAssisted — orthogonal to lifecycle
    public required ProgramMembership Membership { get; init; } // Standalone | InProgram — fill-state, not nullable FK
    public abstract DateOnly Date { get; }                 // derived from each state's own time-truth
}

public sealed record PlannedTrainingSession(DateOnly PlannedFor, IReadOnlyList<SetPrescription> Prescriptions) : TrainingSession;
public sealed record ActiveTrainingSession(DateTime StartedAt, IReadOnlyList<SetEntry> Sets) : TrainingSession;
public sealed record CompletedTrainingSession(
    IReadOnlyList<SetEntry> Sets,
    Period Period,                 // when it actually happened (Instant, or Interval w/ duration)
    EffortState Effort,            // EffortNotReported | EffortReported(PerceivedEffortRatings)
    DecorationState Decoration) : TrainingSession, IAnalyzable;
public sealed record SkippedTrainingSession(DateOnly PlannedFor) : TrainingSession;
```

`SetPrescription` mirrors the set hierarchy with target values (the old `Recommended*`
fields), so planned/actual never half-null each other on one row.

### TrainingProgram

`IsCompleted: bool` → sealed lifecycle subtypes:

```csharp
public abstract record TrainingProgram { /* Id, UserId, Title, StartDate, EndDate, Tags */ }
public sealed record PlannedTrainingProgram(...) : TrainingProgram;
public sealed record ActiveTrainingProgram(...) : TrainingProgram;
public sealed record CompletedTrainingProgram(...) : TrainingProgram;  // can carry a summary
```

### Context (replaces Activity)

Anything non-session with performance relevance. Kind (sleep, stress, pressure-washing)
is a **facet**, not a subtype — subtypes exist only where fields genuinely differ:

```csharp
public abstract record Context
{
    public required Guid ContextId { get; init; }
    public required Guid UserId { get; init; }
    public required Period Period { get; init; }        // Instant or Interval
    public required string Notes { get; init; }
    public required DecorationState Decoration { get; init; }
}

public sealed record ExertionContext(PerceivedEffortRatings Effort) : Context; // physical exertion outside training
public sealed record StateContext : Context;                                   // body/life state; valence in Decoration
```

Duration lives in `Period.Interval` — no separate minutes field.

## Analysis surface

### IAnalyzable + AnalyzableEntry

Domain contract for anything the analytics/RAG layer can consume:

```csharp
public interface IAnalyzable
{
    DecorationState Decoration { get; }
    Period Period { get; }
}
```

`CompletedTrainingSession` and `Context` implement it. Because EF can't query across
tables through an interface, decoration **also** writes a row into a denormalized read
model — the single backing store for retrieval:

```csharp
public sealed record AnalyzableEntry(
    Guid EntryId, EntryKind Kind, Guid UserId,   // Kind = Session | Context
    Period Period,
    IReadOnlyList<Facet> Facets,                  // GIN-indexed jsonb
    Valence Valence,
    float[] Embedding,                            // pgvector
    string SummaryText,
    int DecoratorVersion);
```

### The retrieval primitive

```
retrieve(facets?, window?, semantic?, valence?) → ranked AnalyzableEntry
```

- App analytics: facets + window (balance ledger, avoidance map, ROI, rivalry).
- RAG / workout-texting chat: semantic + window.
- Hidden-cost finder: two calls joined on time (sessions vs next-day contexts/wellness).
- **MCP tool surface = this primitive.** Fixed `FacetAxis` set becomes the tool's enum
  params — the closed axes are what keep the tool description finite and calls valid.

## Interpretation engine

Generalization of the existing ingestion pipeline (`Model/Ingestion/IngestionModels.cs`):

1. **Parse** (LLM): raw text → sets *and* a proposed `Decoration`; runs over Contexts too.
2. **Resolve**: snap entities (movements/equipment) *and* facet values to canonicals via
   embedding similarity; unresolved → user confirmation (existing flow).
3. **Commit**: write domain entity + upsert its `AnalyzableEntry` row.

Every decoration is stamped with `DecoratorVersion`. One engine, three clients:
initial ingest, freeform→structured upgrade, backfill (`WHERE DecoratorVersion < current`).

**Embedding-model changes force a full recompute** — vectors from different models are
incomparable. Extractor-prompt improvements may re-decorate incrementally; embedding
swaps may not be partial.

## Storage

- Relational spine: sessions, programs, contexts, MovementData, FacetValue as tables.
- Polymorphic lists (`SetEntry`, `Period`, `DecorationState`) as jsonb via
  System.Text.Json polymorphic serialization (`[JsonDerivedType]`) behind EF value
  converters (EF's native owned-JSON doesn't handle hierarchies).
- `AnalyzableEntry`: facets as GIN-indexed jsonb; embedding via pgvector EF extension.

## Migration & backfill

**Old data is backfilled into the new model** (decided). Old tables stay until backfill
verifies clean.

- `Activity` rows → `ExertionContext` (Formed utterance semantics; decorate via engine).
- Old sessions/movements/sets → new sessions with structured sets (`Source = Formed`),
  decorated by the engine at current version.
- Backfill is the interpretation engine's first bulk client — no bespoke migration logic.

## Out of scope (unchanged for now)

Chat, Oura, Profile, Wellness, Injury.

## Decision log

| Decision | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Typed vs JSON | Typed sealed domain; jsonb is storage only |
| Freeform logging | First-class choice; model upgrades to rich types when it can; utterance always survives |
| Facet vocabulary | Axes fixed, values growable via semantic resolve + alias accumulation |
| Valence | Lives in Decoration (shared), not on Context |
| Decoration granularity | Facets per-set; embeddings/valence per-session |
| Decoration timing | Sessions: on completion only. Contexts: on creation |
| Session status | Sealed lifecycle subtypes; provenance is a separate axis (kills `AIModified`) |
| Program status | `Planned/Active/CompletedTrainingProgram` subtypes (kills `IsCompleted`) |
| Activity | Deleted; absorbed by `ExertionContext` |
| Movement wrapper | Deleted; flat ordered set list, grouping derivable. `MovementData` kept |
| Old data | Backfilled through the interpretation engine |
| Session date | Derived (`abstract Date`) from each lifecycle state's own time-truth (PlannedFor / StartedAt / Period) — never stored alongside it |

## Build order

1. **Domain core** — sealed hierarchies above + `Decoration` + `IAnalyzable` +
   `AnalyzableEntry` (in progress, this branch).
2. Persistence — EF configs, jsonb converters, pgvector, migrations.
3. Interpretation engine — generalize parse→resolve→commit, add `DecoratorVersion`.
4. Backfill old data.
5. **Balance ledger** — first analytic; pure-facet, validates the whole vocabulary +
   resolution chain end to end.
6. Retrieval primitive + MCP surface.
