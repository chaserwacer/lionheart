# Project Lionheart
Lionheart is a fully fleshed out personal/individual software development project. It is an application that will allow a user to hold and analyze all of their athletic training data. This includes storing and analyzing users wellbeing(wellness), physical activities, stress, sleep, etc. Users are able to sync their Oura Ring data via providing a personal access token.
This project is being developed with the following technologies: C#, Sveltekit, .NET framework, ASP.NET, TailwindCSS, DaisyUI, Microsoft SQLite. <br>
The project uses ASP.NET authentication, which stores user authentication info in browser cookies. The user has multiple options in terms of different items/objects they can store, such as activities and wellness states. API methods are called via a vite proxy, who then persist data to a SQLite database. A TailwindCSS and DaisyUI crafted front-end encourages versatility, allowing for things like users choosing different color themes for the site on the go. I have also implemented usage of the Oura Ring OpenAPI, allowing users to sync their ring data via connecting with a personal access token.
This project has allowed me to explore a vast number of software development facets. Working full stack, constantly switching from front end to backend, has allowed me to get a taste of work I hope to do in the future. This has resulted in lots of practical experience and displayed proficiency and understanding of these different topics. The project has allowed me to improve upon skills learned from my past internship at Lattice Ventures. I look forward to continue developing this application and eventually making it available publicly. <br><br>
This project is still being worked on - it is not fully polished or complete.

## Database
I have added my database files to my .gitignore as I do not want to make any future data public. If you are interested in seeing the structure or seeing the data 'in action' please reach out to me.
